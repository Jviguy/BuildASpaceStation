Roblox Habitat Architect - Hackathon Development Roadmap1. Project OverviewConcept: A top-down, grid-based, modular building game where players design a space habitat based on realistic constraints.Engine: Roblox StudioCore Loop:Configure: Set mission parameters (crew, duration).Select: Choose a modular part from a UI catalogue.Place: Snap the part onto a 2D grid in the 3D world.Validate: The game provides real-time feedback on whether the design meets mission requirements.Goal: To create a fun, educational, and collaborative tool that directly addresses the NASA Space Habitat Challenge.2. Milestone 1: The Core Building Sandbox (First 4-6 Hours)Objective: Establish the fundamental mechanics of placing objects on a grid from a top-down perspective.Task 2.1: Environment & CameraAction: Create a large, flat Part in Workspace to serve as the "Build Plate".Action: Create a LocalScript in StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts to manage the camera.Implementation:Set Camera.CameraType to Scriptable.In a RunService.RenderStepped loop, force the camera's CFrame to a position high above the build plate, looking straight down (e.g., CFrame.new(Vector3.new(0, 120, 0), Vector3.new(0, 0, 0))).Implement basic camera controls: WASD to pan, mouse wheel to zoom.Task 2.2: Module CreationAction: Create 3-5 simple, grid-aligned habitat modules as Models.Implementation:Establish a grid size (e.g., 4 studs). All parts must be multiples of this size.Example Modules:Corridor_1x3 (4x12 studs)Room_2x2 (8x8 studs)Junction_T (8x8 studs)Ensure each Model has a PrimaryPart set.Store these Models in ReplicatedStorage in a folder named HabitatModules.Task 2.3: Snapping and Placement LogicAction: Create a LocalScript to handle mouse movement and snapping.Implementation:Use UserInputService to track the mouse's position.Use Camera:ScreenPointToRay() to cast a ray from the mouse into the 3D world and find its intersection with the build plate.Write a snapping function that takes a Vector3 position and rounds its X and Z coordinates to the nearest multiple of the grid size using the formula: snapped = math.floor(pos / gridSize + 0.5) * gridSize.This script should create a semi-transparent "ghost" of a selected part that follows the snapped mouse position.3. Milestone 2: UI and Interaction (Next 3-5 Hours)Objective: Create the user interface for selecting and manipulating habitat modules.Task 3.1: Parts Catalogue UIAction: Create a ScreenGui in StarterGui for the main UI.Implementation:Add a ScrollingFrame to act as the parts catalogue.Write a script that iterates through the HabitatModules folder in ReplicatedStorage. For each module, it should create an ImageButton in the ScrollingFrame.Use ViewportFrames to generate a live thumbnail of each module for its button icon.Task 3.2: Player Input & StateAction: Script the catalogue buttons and player input.Implementation:When a catalogue button is clicked, a variable in the placement script should be updated to track the currently selected module.The ghost part from Milestone 1 should now reflect this selection.Listen for left-click to confirm placement.Listen for the 'R' key to rotate the ghost part by 90 degrees.4. Milestone 3: Networking and Finalization (Next 2-4 Hours)Objective: Make building a permanent, server-side action that all players can see.Task 4.1: Client-Server CommunicationAction: Create a RemoteEvent in ReplicatedStorage named PlaceModuleEvent.Implementation:When the player left-clicks to place a module, the placement LocalScript fires this RemoteEvent.It should pass the following arguments: moduleName, snappedPosition (CFrame), and orientation (number).Task 4.2: Server-Side LogicAction: Create a Script in ServerScriptService to handle module placement.Implementation:The script listens for the PlaceModuleEvent.OnServerEvent.When the event is received, it performs validation (e.g., checks if the area is already occupied).If valid, it clones the requested module Model from ReplicatedStorage, sets its CFrame, and parents it to the Workspace.It should fire a sound event back to the client(s) to play a satisfying "Ker-Snap!" sound effect.5. Milestone 4: The Game Layer (Challenge Requirements) (Next 4-6 Hours)Objective: Implement the specific NASA challenge constraints and feedback systems.Task 5.1: Mission Configuration & LogicAction: Create a startup UI for setting mission parameters (crew size, duration).Action: Create a ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage called MissionConstraints.Implementation: This module will contain the NASA data (e.g., area per person for 'Sleep', 'Exercise', etc.) and functions to calculate total requirements based on the initial mission setup.Task 5.2: Zoning SystemAction: Add a "Zoning Tool" to the UI catalogue.Implementation: This tool allows players to click and drag to create colored, semi-transparent Parts on the build plate floor. These parts represent functional zones (e.g., blue for Sleep, orange for Galley). Store the zone type and area in the Part's Attributes.Task 5.3: Real-Time Validation HUDAction: Create a persistent HUD element that lists mission requirements.Implementation:The HUD should display items like: Sleep Quarters: 0 / 24m² ❌.Scripts will constantly check the total area of all placed "Sleep" zones and update the HUD in real-time. The status icon changes to a ✅ when the requirement is met.Implement adjacency checks: when a zone is placed, check its neighbors. If a conflict occurs (Sleep next to Exercise), make both zone parts pulse red.6. Milestone 5: Polish and Submission (Final 2-3 Hours)Objective: Refine the experience and prepare for submission.Task 6.1: Bug Fixing and UX PolishPlaytest and fix any bugs in placement, rotation, or UI.Add simple instructions and tooltips.Refine the visuals and sound design.Task 6.2: Submission AssetsRecord a clear video demonstrating the entire gameplay loop, from mission setup to a fully validated habitat design.Take high-quality screenshots.Finalize the project description, highlighting how it meets all challenge objectives.
